## Better Chases+ is a continuation of Eddlm's & Guadmaz's famous Better Chases and Arrest Warrants mods

### Features

    Revamped Wanted Level to be a progressive system with extensive customization
    A more realistic and proportional police response
    Arrest Warrant system that adds new gameplay after a chase ends
    Significantly enhances the overall police gameplay



### ARREST WARRANTS
Arrest Warrants are a new part of the gameplay, escaping the police isnâ€™t enough anymore - now you must continue to avoid police or risk resuming a chase you thought you escaped. Once wanted the police can identify you and your vehicle if you let them get too close. Once you escape you will have an Arrest Warrant issued for you and/or your vehicle and police will be looking for those descriptions.

    Each character & vehicle can have their own arrest warrant. If the police identify your vehicle in a chase, escape and then get a new vehicle or risk the police recognizing it and starting the chase again.
    Change your appearance by changing clothes or painting a vehicle to make it harder for police to recognize you.
    Arrest Warrants are saved and loaded with the game.



### BETTER CHASES
With Better Chases the police have a much larger range of responses based on your actions. A chase begins with a limited police response and depending how you try to evade police will determine the force used against you. Drive recklessly by hitting pedestrians or police and you will quickly find the chase has become much more serious.

    Overhauled how the wanted system progresses from 1 star to 5 stars via crimes & more.
    Extensive customization allows you to tailor your own experience.
    Build the wanted level based on crimes you commit during a police chase.
    Police aggressiveness is now controllable and proportional.
